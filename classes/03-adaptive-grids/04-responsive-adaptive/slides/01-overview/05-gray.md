# Grey Area (Gray Area?)

Is this Responsive or Adaptive?
- Media queries to how many items shown
- Flexbox/Grid to vary items/row w/o media query

Read multiple search results: "Responsive vs Adaptive"
- Will get different answers
- Doesn't really matter
    - What we call it doesn't impact users
- I'll call these "Adaptive"
