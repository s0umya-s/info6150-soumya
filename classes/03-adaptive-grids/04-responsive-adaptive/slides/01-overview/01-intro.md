# **Responsive** and **Adaptive** Designs

- Confusing Terminology
- "**Responsive**" can be an umbrella term for both
  - Or treated as distinct concept
- Both about effective pages at different sizes
- Neither denies nor requires **gutters**
  - Some designs don't go full width
  - Essentially a max width on content
  - Has empty/background "gutters" on sides
  - https://examplecat.com/ over 700px wide
