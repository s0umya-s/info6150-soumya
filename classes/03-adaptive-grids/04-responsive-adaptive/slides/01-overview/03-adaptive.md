# **Adaptive** Design

- Changing layout at certain **breakpoints**
  - Layout = Arrangement of elements
  - Ex: Change number of blocks in a row
  - Ex: Change row of items to column
  - Ex: Menu becomes "Hamburger Menu"
    - See MDN as example
- Not automatic
    - Dev has to code the rules to apply this
- Allows for good use of space
  - Not just wrapped use of space
