# How?

TL;DR: Usually **Media queries**
- CSS operates off of 2+ options for layout
  - Based on **viewport** dimensions
  - Can reorder elements in layout
  - Can collapse menus/sections
- May target:
  - Mobile/Desktop
  - Mobile/tablet/desktop
  - Landscape/portrait(s)/desktop/widescreen
  - Or just where content fits better
