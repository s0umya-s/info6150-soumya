# Summary - Setting Meta viewport

- Mobile often render with different viewport size
  - Then visually zooms in
- Can cause disconnect with media queries
- Override with:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```
- Easy to forget!
- Esp. if you don't use mobile view in DevTools
- Remember to do on assignments!
