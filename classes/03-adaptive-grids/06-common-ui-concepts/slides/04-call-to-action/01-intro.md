# Call to Action

- Trying to get the user to take an action
  - May be page concept or screen concept
  - Usually a button, link, perhaps a small form
    - With "punchy" text/colors

Ex: **"Find out more"**, **"Compare Prices"**, **"Register for free trial"**, **Download Now**

- Often "CTA" in designer text
- Don't want conflict between CTAs!
  - Ideally only one/screen 
  - Max one/section
