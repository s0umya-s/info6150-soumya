# Designers and Affordance

Designers LOVE to say something "affords" something
- Easy to lose track of what is being said
  - Jargon is not inherently good or bad
  - Designers definitely use _words_
  - I sometimes fail to connect them into ideas
- Affordance is an important concept
  - How do users know how to use your UI?
