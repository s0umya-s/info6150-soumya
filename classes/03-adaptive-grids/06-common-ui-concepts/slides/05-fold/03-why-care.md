# Why do we care about the Fold?

- People may not want to scroll
  - If above the fold is boring, why bother?
- People may not know to scroll (desktop)
  - Don't hide scrollability 
  - Scroll Affordance?
- Wasting time (particularly mobile)
  - Why give me content if I just have to scroll?
  - Poor UX bleeds into user opinions
