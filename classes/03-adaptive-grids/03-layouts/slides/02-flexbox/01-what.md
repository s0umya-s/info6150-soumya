# Why and What is Flexbox?

Original CSS all based on how items (text) align in flow
- No grouping outside of containers with flow
- Everything based on the needs of content

**Flexbox arranges child elements**
- Into row(s) or column(s)
- Most often, 1 row or 1 column
- Children set their base size
