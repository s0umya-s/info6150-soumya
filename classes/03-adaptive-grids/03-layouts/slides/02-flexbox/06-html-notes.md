# Notes about our Menu HTML

- Very basic example 
- Menus are a common situation
- Semantic `<nav>` is good
    - No visual effect
    - Definite semantic effect
    - Labels our "navigation section"
        - Not all links are in a `<nav>` section
    - `<menu>` is for controls, not navigation
- We are lacking class names
    - You will later switch to using class names
