# Before anything else: `flex-direction` 

`display: flex;` arranged our child elements in a **row**
- Flexbox arranges children in one dimension
- We can also arrange vertically instead of horizontally

```css
ul {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;

    /* other css here */
}
```

Let's set `flex-direction: row;` and keep going
