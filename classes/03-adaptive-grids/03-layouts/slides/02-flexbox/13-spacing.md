# Spacing with Flexbox

- Can set `margin`/`padding` on parent/children
- Can also set a `gap`
    - Space between rows/columns

```css
ul { 
    display: flex;
    gap: 2rem;
}
```
What if we want an even distribution of space?
- Try `justify-content: space-around;`
- Try `justify-content: space-between;`
