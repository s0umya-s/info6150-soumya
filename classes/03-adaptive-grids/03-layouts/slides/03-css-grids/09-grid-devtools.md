# Examining Our Grid

```css
body { 
    display: grid;
}
```
Doesn't really show any visual change!
- "Inspect" the `<body>` in DevTools
    - See the `display: grid;` in "Styles"
    - See the "grid" next to element in "Elements"
    - Hover over element start tag in "Elements"
        - See the grid lines in rendered HTML!
