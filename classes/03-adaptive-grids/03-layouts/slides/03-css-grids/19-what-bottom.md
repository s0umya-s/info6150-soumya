# The Footer IS at the bottom

...of the `<body>` element

Oh, you want it at the bottom of the viewport?
- Need to fill that with `<body>`

```css 
body { 
    /* Other stuff like grid stuff here */

    min-height: 100vh;
}
```

`vh` is "percent of viewport height" units
- `100vh` is 100% of viewport height
