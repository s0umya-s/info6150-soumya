# CSS Grids

Places child elements into cells
- Based on rows AND columns 

Grids mimic the old table-based layouts
- Without their pain
- Because layout (mostly) separate from structure

Children can be told to span multiple "cells" of the grid

Grids put the emphasis on the layout over the content
