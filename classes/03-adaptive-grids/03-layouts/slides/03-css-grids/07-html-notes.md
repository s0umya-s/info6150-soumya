# Notes about our HTML

- Good semantic HTML
    - **landmark** elements 
        - **header**, **nav**, **main**, **footer**
- Needs class names!
    - Assignment will use element types
        - To exercise your **selector** understanding
    - Later you should use **semantic class names**
        - Element types will be used many ways
        - Compound element selectors invite **specificity issues**
- Alt on logo was inadequate
