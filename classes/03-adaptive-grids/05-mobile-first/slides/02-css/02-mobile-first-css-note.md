# When Mobile First CSS isn't more simple

A "hamburger menu" 
- Or other "collapsing" navigation structure

Reverse of previous example
- Collapsing sections/menus are more complex CSS
- If written Mobile First CSS
    - Desktop "undoes" the complex CSS

You have to consider and decide at start
- What is the most simple set of CSS options?
