# Properties Within A CSS Rule

How are you ordering the list of declarations?
- Alphabetical  
  - Pro: Easy to automate in a large team
  - Con: Low-value
  - Ex: `height` and `width` and `min-width` far apart
- By Purpose (My preferred)
  - Ex: Display/position/box model/color/text/etc
  - Decide which properties are which purpose
  - Separate by blank lines ("**paragraphs**")
    - **Programming is Communication**
