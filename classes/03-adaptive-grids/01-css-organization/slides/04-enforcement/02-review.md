# Code Review

Most workplaces: 
- Everyone has their code changes reviewed
- PR just like assignments

Unlike assignments:
- Less "is this correct?"
- More "Can we maintain this over time?"
    - Conventions checked here
- Some "Are there subtle bugs"

Warning: Expected you confirmed basic working!
