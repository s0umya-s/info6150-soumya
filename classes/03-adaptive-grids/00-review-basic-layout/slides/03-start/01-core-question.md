# Where do I start?

Most common, important question

I recommend a "top down" approach:
- Arrange the biggest, outermost elements
    - Positions, sizes
- Give those basics like padding, colors, typography
    - Don't worry about pieces inside yet
- Then take one of those and do the next inner layer
    - One layer at a time
    - Arrange, box model, colors, and text
