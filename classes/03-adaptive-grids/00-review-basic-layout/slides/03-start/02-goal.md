# Why this?

Two Goals:
- You want to break up into solvable problems
    - "Do it all" isn't solvable
    - "Arrange these child elements" is solvable
- You don't want to waste effort
    - Child first can look wrong after styling parent
    - May involve a bit of judgment
        - Move back and forth as helpful
    - Minimize work you have to redo
    - But doing work is better than being stuck
